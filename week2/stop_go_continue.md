# Stop Go Continue

Note: This is to help you plan how you will teach the next cohort (as well as influence how your next few weeks/months will go)!

## Stop
- 'Doing TDD wrong'
- Moving goalposts (e.g. use QUint, you can choose, actually you have to use it - change your projects)

## Go
- Reading about async functions in pre-course material
- Use Notes repo to share resources with each other
- Use same testing framework consistently
- Resources tab on gitbook to include (article?) on differences between frameworks e.g. Jasmine & QUnit
- 5 minute breaks
- Introduce modularisation e.g. through workshop
- Reverse order of FizzBuzz & dwyl

## Continue
- Emphasise starting projects with design phase
- Update gitbook as/when decisions change during the week (e.g. learning outcomes, resources, etc.)
- Roman numerals as an example
- Research day every week
- TDD on all projects
- Heads up on next week's topics - not necessarily compulsory homework
- Swapping pairs
- Learning git and TDD through own projects
- Pushing work up to github regulary

### Questions:
  
  Should the order of Monday workshops be different?  Between the 2 morning challenges and the DWYL tutorial, what should the order be?  Should FizzBuzz kata be last workshop of the day on Monday?
