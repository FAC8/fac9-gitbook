# Stop Go Continue

## Stop

1. A project that doesn’t involve testing time
- more info on project earlier on in the week so that they can read up on certain things. e.g. stopwatch - testing time in javascript
- more direction in using QUnit docs, more guidance in using the available assertions
- maybe build stopwatch as part of morning challenge and then in project use TDD to build stopwatch?
- emphasis on writing code and deleting it before starting TDD

## Go

1. More emphasis on FACs values - collaborative learning, all here to help each other 

2. Jasmine features - good for async testing, has good features. Jarkyn’s workshop was good. Focus on QUnit but still have a workshop on jasmine so people are aware of another testing tool
3. Keep git book up to date
4. Optional homework on strengthening what they’ve already learnt

## Continue
1. TDD
2. css and sass - want to learn sass. More css practice

## Notes

1. Create readme file as well as video
2. Create a place for resources so that they don’t get lost in bitter. E.g. a repo or gitbook. 
3. Most people liked screen casting
