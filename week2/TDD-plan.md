## Timetable

### Monday

* 10-11 Bes workshop: (approx: writing your own functions to test a piece of code) 
* We will give them a bit of reading over the weekend (Resources--yup and so far there are only 2 short articles) 
* Clear Introduction writing a test (first thing Monday), what it is and how to do it.
* Qunit: basic introduction then send them off to do: vending maching tutorial (DWYL)
* DWYL TDD tutorials-- afternoon workshop in groups (Monday)
* If they finish early on Monday: have them look at edx course on Jasmine (it is quite quick; they don't need to finish it--can keep looking at it Monday evening).  Also, can point them to the ReadMe questions they are not doing, but can say they are subjects for further exploration, all related to TDD and all good to gain some understanding of.

### Tuesday

* 10-11 Tuesday morning: Bes workshop
* Tuesday morning: ping pong pair programming: We are introducing both Jasmine and ping pong pair programming.
* Tuesday morning: Jasmine: Introduction plus Roman Numerals code-along (Monday)--Anneka.  First we start with basic code-along for a few numbers, then do a ping pong version for a few numbers, then send them off to finish it ping pong pair programming.
* Tuesday afternoon: Read-Me Day, but we are doing video tutorials/screen casts on testing done in pairs with ping pong pair programming (they can do a section of their Roman Numerals kata).  Since screen casts are done in pairs; there will be 8.  Pair up with someone not in your group of 4.
* Show screen casts to each other.
* Tuesday 5:30 we may have a speaker: Halima from Codurance
* If there is time: Actually do the ReadMes (or more on the edx course on Jasmine).

### Wednesday:

* 10-11 Wednesday morning: Bes workshop
* Mattia to give quick overview of async testing and give them stopwatch project.
* (Note: Jarkyn is coming in the following week to do async testing for API week)
* For stopwatch project: The idea is to follow the TDD cycle to create a stop watch, using ping pong. Split into your groups of 4. Then pair up within that group (so there will be 8 stopwatches created).
* Stretch goals: countdown timer, split timmer, any other functionality eg, translator. They can add as much functionality as they like! Be creative!

### Thursday:
* 10-11 Thursday morning: Bes workshop
* Continue stopwatch projects!

### Friday:
* 10-11 Friday morning: Bes workshop
* Code Review
* Respond to Issues
* Stop Go Continue: Would we like to move morning workshops to earlier in the morning, ie, 9:30 or 9:00?
* Presentations


* Optionals for the week: Mattia to introduce testing with legacy code and possibly arrange speaker 


### Learning Objectives:
* What is TDD and how to implement
* How to process documentation
* Set up and use Jasmine
* Synchronous vs asynchronous and how to test

  * Synchronous tests
  * Top 5 assertions
  * Test asynchronously
2. What is TDD?
  * Create a TDD screen cast
  * TDD life cycle
  * Red Green Refactor (Why is this concept useful?)
3. Continuous Integration 
  * Explanation 
4. Unit and Integration Testing
  * What are the differences
  * What are the pros and cons
  * Examples of each
