## Preparation
### TODO
* 10-11 Bes workshop: (approx: writing your own functions to test a piece of code) 
* We will give them a bit of reading over the weekend (Resources?)
* Clear Introduction writing a test (first thing Monday), what it is and how to do it.
* Qunit: Introduction plus Roman Numerals code-along (Monday)--Anneka
* DWYL TDD tutorials-- afternoon workshop in groups (Monday)
* Tuesday morning: ping pong pair programming
* Tuesday afternoon: Read-Me Day, but we are doing video tutorials on testing done in pairs with ping pong pair programming
* Wednesday: Mattia introduce Jasmine and legacy code TDD and possibly arrange speaker 
* End of Wednesday: quick overview of how to do async testing give them stopwatch project
* (Note: Jarkyn is coming in the following week to do async testing for API week)
* 
* TDD freestyle demo  Roman Numerals, and then have them do afternoon workshop using dwyl tutorial (change machine).  I think sticking with Quint and then introducing quickly the idea of Jasmine (ie, there are other testing frameworks--here it is, etc, look over the weekend at it for next week).  
* research modules for readMe topic -- do video tutorials for ping pong.

### Learning Objectives:
* What is TDD and how to implement
* Synchronous vs asynchronous and how to test
* How to process documentation
* Set up and use Jasmine

### README topics
1. Jasmine
  * Set up environment
  * Synchronous tests
  * Top 5 assertions
  * Test asynchronously
2. What is TDD?
  * Create a TDD screen cast
  * TDD life cycle
  * Create a TDD screen cast
  * Red Green Refactor (Why is this concept useful?)
3. Continuous Integration (fourgroups)
  * Explanation (Readme form)
  * Set up Travis Screen cast
4. Unit and Integration Testing
  * What are the differences
  * What are the pros and cons
  * Examples of each


### Timetable
Monday:

10-11.Workshop: Walk through setting up Jasmine environ, tests for morning challenge to be written

11-13.Morning challenge: write the functions to pass the tests in an environment set up with Jasmine, see simpletests.html

<-- Seem to remember some problems with above exercise despite being a good one - Tests were bad possibly? Needs to be rewritten/redone in Jasmine -->

14-xx.Readmes/tutorials
Tuesday:
10-11:30 functional programming morning challenge, does not have to be related to testing. (MATT)
11:30-13 Roman Numerals workshop, code along. use ping pong (RUTH, CONOR)
14-18 Vending Machine, can you use ping pong ?. (RUTH, CONOR)
time? add 8th light talk, on the broader importance of testing and paired programming, (dont use Numerals tutorials)
Wednesday:
10-11:30 write tests for our functions (qunit or jasmine), to show the value of TDD, still need to write. (NAAZ, RUTH) 11:30 introduce the stopwatch. The idea is to follow the TDD cycle to create a stop watch, using ping pong. (NAAZ, RUTH) Split into your groups of 4. Then pair up within that group.
Both pairs write tests which fail.
pass them onto the other pair which makes them pass.
follow tutorial with this ping/pong format.
great project with TDD ingrained into there brain!!!!
stretch goals, countdown timer, split timmer, any other functionality eg, translator.
Add as much functionality as you like! you can go your own way
Thursday:
Carry On!!!
Normal Friday Structure
Code Review
Respond to Issues
Stop Go Continue
Presentations
