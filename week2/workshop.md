# Monday Workshop

[DWYL TDD Tutorial](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd)

### Starter Questions:
* Easy questions first: What is the Red-Green-Refactor cycle?
* What is ping pong pair programming?

## Vending Machine Change Calculator
* 3 hour Workshop
* Cohort pairs off and builds the vending machine

### Emphasis is on Red-Green-Refactor cycle and ping pong pair programming work flow.

### Workshop Goals:

* Get comfortable with Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle
* Practise ping ponging when writing tests
* If all the alliteration wasn't enough of a hint: Have fun!

### Things to Remember:
* What's a sensible first test for a function?
* Is this the simplest possible test you can think of?
* What test are you going to add next?
* As you work through the problem are all your tests still passing? If not, why not?
* As you work through the problem are you working from the outside in, or are you trying to solve the problem in a linear sequence from top to bottom? (Hint: try working from the outside in, always thinking about the inputs and outputs of the code block you are working on.)
