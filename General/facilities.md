# Space 🌌
The space here is shared between the current cohort, graduates of previous cohorts, Dan and *dwyl*.

*dwyl* is run by Nelson and Ines. Nelson is our lead technical mentor and Ines is director of Founders & Coders. *dwyl* is an agency that employs some of our graduates on a freelance basis. You will hear more about *dwyl* in due course.

## Facilities 🏡
We have just one loo. Hopefully it will be enough, but this space is now shared by over 30 people, so it will get well used.

The kitchen area is used by all of us. Please clear up after yourself and don't leave stuff in the sink or on the counter.

The fridge tends to get pretty full. Please put anything you wish to keep overnight in a container. Milk is for sharing.

We also have a shower room.
