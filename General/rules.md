# Rules

* **Whilst you're a student, arrive on time & let people know in advance if you're going to be away**. Lots of people are giving freely of their time and knowledge to make FAC possible and giving up other commitments to be here.
* **Tidy up after yourself** (at least!). With so many of us in the space, it's easy for the kitchen area to get dirty really quickly. Wash up your crockery rather than forget it in the sink, wipe down the counter area you've been using and we'll all be a lot happier.
* **Recyling and Rubbish**:
  * Please all take responsibility for this, both the recyling and rubbish get taken out and are stored at the end of the road in a trash bin. Take the keys and ask someone to show you where it is.
* **Clean desk policy**. We have a clean-desk policy. Please leave your desk clear before you leave each day.
* **Hot desking**. Please sit anywhere downstairs when you arrive each morning.
* **20-minute rule**. Struggle is good, but not too much of it. As a general rule, if you cannot solve a problem within 20 minutes, stop and talk to somebody about it (there should be a timer on your desk).
* **Long Live Vanilla Javascript**. For the first 10 weeks of the course, we want you to use vanilla javascript for everything. That means no Frameworks backend or frontend! (i.e. no Bootstrap/jQuery etc...)
  * This is for your own benefit, trust me (and all of previous FAC cohorts) it works.
