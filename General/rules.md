# Code of Conduct
 
 FAC is a collaborative, peer-led learning environment. This means taking an interest in and conducting yourself to the benefit of everyone around you's learning:
 
- Arrive at 09:45 to be ready to start at 10:00 and let people know in advance if you’re going to be away **as if you don’t others will be delayed by your absence.**
- Please sit anywhere downstairs when you arrive each morning, not at the same desk, and aim to work with a different person each day **as you all have something different to share and learn from.**
- Always pair program. Do not work on your own, and aim for equal contribution and mutual understanding of the code in group projects **as the success of most projects is dependent upon how well you work as a team.**
 - Do not stress over completing projects. It is OK if you present something unfinished **as its a learning exercise and you’re not in competition with each other.**
 - But work hard on readme’s and group resources, and ensure you code review others projects **as you’re depriving yourself and others from benefiting from each other’s work otherwise.**
 - Struggle is good, but not too much of it. If you cannot solve a problem within 20 minutes, stop and talk to somebody about it **as chances are someone in your cohort (or the last) can help you with it.**
 - Tidy up after yourself and maintain the space **as if you don’t someone else will have to.**
   * Wash up your crockery rather than leave it in the sink, and wipe down the counter area you’ve been using
   * Please take responsibility for recycling and rubbish. Both get taken out and are stored at the end of the road in a trash bin. Take the keys and ask someone to show you where it is.
   * Please leave your desk clear before you leave each day.
 - For the first 10 weeks of the course, use vanilla javascript for everything. That means no Frameworks backend or frontend! (i.e. no Bootstrap/jQuery etc...) **This is for your own benefit, trust me (and all of previous FAC cohorts) it works! :)**
