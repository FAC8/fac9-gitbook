# Code of Conduct ‚úçüèΩ

FAC is a collaborative, peer-led learning environment. This means taking an interest in and conducting yourself to the benefit of everyone around you's learning:

- Arrive at 09:45 to be ready for a prompt start at 10:00 and let the group know (in advance, if possible) if you‚Äôre not going to be in, **as if you don‚Äôt others will be delayed by your absence.**
- FAC has a hotdesking policy. Please sit anywhere downstairs when you arrive each morning, not at the same desk, and aim to work with a different person each day ‚Äì **we all have different skills to share and learn from.**
- We ‚ù§Ô∏è pair programming. Don't work on your own, and aim for equal contribution and mutual understanding of the code in group projects; **the success of most projects is dependent upon how well you work as a team.**
- Don't stress over completing projects. It's okay if you present something unfinished as **it's a learning exercise, and we‚Äôre not in competition with each other.**
- FAC is built on an ethos of peer learning. Work hard on readmes and group resources, and ensure you code review others' projects ‚Äì **you‚Äôre depriving yourself and others from benefiting from each other‚Äôs work otherwise.**
- Struggle is good, but not too much of it. If you cannot solve a problem within 20 minutes, stop and talk to somebody about it, **as chances are someone can help.**
- Tidy up after yourself and take care of the space, because **we all have to work here:**
  * Wash up your crockery rather than leave it in the sink, and wipe down the counter area you‚Äôve been using.
  * Please take responsibility for recycling and rubbish. Both get taken out and are stored at the end of the road; just ask someone to show you where it is if you're unsure.
  * Please leave your desk clear before you leave each day.
  * Follow the rules regarding the fridge ‚Äì don't leave food in there for more than a few days, and please throw away anything you see that's gone mouldy.
- For the first 10 weeks of the course, **stick to vanilla JavaScript**. That means no frameworks, backend or frontend (i.e. no Bootstrap/jQuery etc...). This is for the benefit of your understanding of JavaScript; trust us (and all the previous FAC cohorts) ‚Äì it works!
