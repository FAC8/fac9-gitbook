# Meetup Rotas

As members of the FAC family, we expect you to help run our meetup groups Coding for Everyone (every Monday, 18:30 - 20:00) and Coding for Women (every other Tuesday, 18:30 - 20:00). 

We need at least two people of any gender present at every meetup to greet people, watch the space and lock up at the end of the session.

Please add your availability to both:
