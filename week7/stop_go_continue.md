# Stop Go Continue

### Stop

##### Project achievability

Project not achievable in 2 days, perhaps a good thing?
This is actually a good thing, just being made aware of topics is what is important

The projects have been too similar, we should choose different project types
especiallly true with a new team, teams just use the same code from last time

Perhaps reduce the project by getting around some of the things that takes a lot of time, e.g. auth

People thought using sass, handlebars, hapi all at once was not a good thing

Consider a half day project to resolve this problem

##### Hapi Plugins
There is too much magic going on.

Everyone in the team has to understand everything that is going on and everyone should be involved in the process.

30 mins to understand the code may not be enough, but it is actually ok to not understand the code, it is not a benefit for everything to be totally understood, but sometimes it is good to just accept what is going on


### Go

##### Tequila shots
resolve the tension

##### Projects by sprint
Introduce agile working processes before going through a dual database project in two sprints

##### Record tutorials
Record the Monday morning walkthroughs for those who have missed it or would like to refresh their knowledge (will experiment with next weeks tutorial)


### Continue

##### Morning challenge
Very good layout, good layout, gitbook was kept up to date, less pressure to finish project, agile working practices

##### Readme learning outcomes
Readme learning outcomes (implemented by Andrew) good to have these at the bottom of the readme, these were very useful


##### Readme questions
A good idea to raise issues, but should be implemented better, use a question master
Good incentive for everyone to read every readme - very good to continue
Just before lunch, lolly stick people to go through the issues they raised, would be good to review the issues together
