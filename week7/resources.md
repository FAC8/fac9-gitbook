# Resources

Hapi is a big framework, we don't expect you to learn all of it in a week! (We still don't even take advantage of all it's crazy good features).

Here are some resources we found very useful to get you started:

+ [Hapi.js website](http://hapijs.com/tutorials) - these are a fantastic set of tutorials
+ [MakeMeHapi tutorial](https://github.com/hapijs/makemehapi) - install this and have a go
+ [Dwyl learn Hapi](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-hapi) - Dwyl's repo on Hapi (has a brilliant set of further resources)
+ [Introduction to Node Servers with Hapi](https://egghead.io/courses/introduction-to-node-servers-with-hapi-js) - these are some eggheads tutorials on Hapi
