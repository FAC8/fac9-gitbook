### Rebuild Wordpress (build a CMS)

This week we want you to build a content management system (like wordpress), it's a bit like a turbo charged version of your blog in week 1 - but way more modular and reusable!

### Core Features

+ Create content (i.e. make a new post)
+ Read content (i.e. show all posts)
+ Update content (i.e. update an existing post)
+ Delete content
+ User logins
+ Validation of user input (protect yourself against script injections!)
+ Modular html and css (make use of SASS and Handlebars to organise your code / make it reusable)
+ At least 80% codecov

### Bonus Features

+ Ability to add users
+ Ability to add new pages
+ Content filters
+ Adding a rich text editor for content input (like https://www.tinymce.com)
+ Deploy to Heroku

It's a lot to get through in 2 days, but we believe in you! :) And remember

+ This is all about learning.
+ Try your best to get the core features done by the end of the week, but if you don't, it's not the end of the world - (look back through it on the weekend and play around with some of the stuff you didn't finish).
+ Your whole team MUST understand ALL the features you're implementing (if they don't, either explain it fully, or DON'T implement it)

Good luck, and have fun!
