# Project

Your project this week is to build a simple hapi app using test driven development that queries at least two APIs on the backend and uses the retrieved data to populate a handlebars template that will use server-side rendering to be displayed on the front-end.

Here is a list of [public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) you might consider. Please bare in mind if the API requires the user to log-in to 

What you choose to build with this data and how you choose to display it is up to you. But I would suggest you

* In the planning phases, have a think about user stories. Who are you building this for? What problem are you trying to solve? You might find the notes on Nelson's talk in your [notes](https://github.com/FAC9/notes/tree/master/week5/nelson-workshop) repo useful.
* Try to build this tdd as far as you are able to using the techniques and `server.inject` method that Francesco showed you.
* Aim for as high test-coverage as possible.
* Continue to modularise
