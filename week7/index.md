The focus this week will be a node framework called Hapi.

Using a framework like hapi, (along with a few other goodies you'll be learning) really take building web applications to the next level!


### Important note:

## No Promises!

Promises are banned until the end of the course (by the end of week 11/12), only use callbacks. This is for a similar reason we don't use jQuery or Boostrap during the course - learning the fundamentals gives you greater power later to use more advanced language features or libraries.
