# Guidance for running projects

### Teams of four
Initially. we recommend working in teams of four.

### Work, and take responsiblity, in pairs
In general, work, and take on roles, in pairs, so you can give each other support and learn from each other. 

### Project managers
Pick a project management team of two. One can take the lead and the other can provide support. Take it in turns to take the lead and provide support for each other. Project managers' responsibilites are:
+ Client communication
+ Running the morning standups
+ Ensuring that communication guidelines are followed

### Code reviewers
Pick a code review team of two. One can take the lead and the other can provide support. Take it in turns to take the lead and provide support for each other. Coder reviewers' responsibilities are:
+ Reviewing, commenting on, and eventually merging pull requests
+ Ensuring that your team is following code style guidelines
+ Insisting on adequate code coverage

### Get the client to check their assumptions
If you have time, get the client to go and research their assumptions about their users, before agreeing the scope of the project.

### Agree the scope as user stories
Don't start working until you have agreed the scope with the client, expressed as a series of user stories, and added as issues in GitHub.

### Communicate via GitHub issues
All non-verbal communication about the project should be done via comments on GitHub issues.

### Re-direct email conversations to GitHub issues
If the client communicates something significant via email, paste their communication into a new or existing GitHub issue, @ them, so they get notified, and reply-all to their email with a link to the comment. As a rule, do not respond directly to emails except to link to your response in a GitHub issue. Do this with patience and understanding. It may take your client a while to get used to this way of communicating. It is your job to help them get there gently.

### Miscommunication cannot be solved without a conversation
Do not attempt to resolve apparent miscommunication via electroinc means. Pick up the phone.
