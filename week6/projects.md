You have the following options. Whatever you choose you must make use of JOIN queries and provide a way to authenticate users.

1. Most prescriptive: build a platform for writing and sharing reviews of coding resources. User stories:
  - I can log in.
  - I can see a list of recent reviews.
  - I can see a list of reviewed resources.
  - I can create, edit and view my own reviews.
  - I can see a list of reviews of a particular resource.
  - I can click on a listed review to read it.
  - (optional extra) I can see a list of reviews by a particular user.
  
2. Less prescriptive: a review site for any kind of media. Same user stories.
 
3. Least prescriptive: anything!
