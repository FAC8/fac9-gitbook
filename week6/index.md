Projects. THE WHOLE WEEK.

We are not telling what to do, only which technologies to use, so get thinking of a cool idea!

Whatever you do, it must have a way to authenticate users and manage sessions, and it must make use of SQL JOIN queries.

There will be time to do a workshop during the week on whatever subject is causing most difficulty.

Projects due for code review by Friday lunchtime as usual.
