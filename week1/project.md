# Project 
* Wednesday - Thursday
* Friday raising issues / answer issues (morning) + presentation (afternoon)

## Build a blog using GitHub Pages

The first task is to build a group blog. This will be a permanent record of your work over the next several weeks. You will use it to share with each other and to showcase Founders & Coders to the world.

This is an open-ended project on which you will be working for two days. You can make the blog as elaborate as you like and use it as a playground for as many technologies as you are able to research and implement.

As a minimum requirement, your blog should have profiles of each of your group members and each profile should include links to your ```Linkedin```, ```Github``` and ```Codewars``` accounts. Your website should be published on ```gh-pages```. We will also be checking your site for accessibility on Tenon.io

###Workshop - tips

* Use the first part of today's activity for a design session, so that the groups can get some experience of creating collaborative designs. 

* The second part will be dedicated to doing coding that arises from the design session.

* Some of this might seem quite basic, but the emphasis here is getting experience designing web pages collaboratively, and coding as a team of four.

* The ultimate aim is to take a very simple design concept from the drawing board to a web page as a team!

###Suggestions for the design Session (45 Minutes)
* Come up with an idea for your blog.

* If your user will be accessing your web page via a mobile device - it     should be simple enough to use on a mobile.

* Don't make it too complicated.

#####We're looking for answers to the following questions:
* What would your overall app do?
* Who is your user?
* How will you enhance the user experience?
* How will you make it pretty?
* Try drawing out wireframes of your app. It's okay to design parts of a page that won't function (e.g. menu buttons) as well as think about elements that might enhance your user's experience.  Try to think about how it might break or annoy a user.

###Planning and setup (1450) (30 mins)
* Write a README for your app - WHY / WHAT / HOW. Finish with a bullet-point project plan, and mark your more ambitious features as "stretch goals".

* Groups should split into pairs again, making sure they are constantly communicating with each other. Divide the tasks between the pairs, and decide how you will work together to avoid conflicts in the code. Two spaces or four...?


###Do the codes (1530) (90 mins)
The goal isn't to break new ground, it is to get students working together (and hopefully enjoying it!).

Think about all the worst practices you dealt with in the first exercise and avoid them.
Keep updating your README as you proceed - it will form the basis for your presentation at the end of the week.

Presentations (45 minutes)

As a team, present your very first FAC website (of many). Start with your README, then demo your app, then show us your code. Tell us all about the sacrifices you had to make to functionality as the deadline approached. What would you do differently next time? What lessons did you learn about working together as a team? What coding quirks did you encounter - what warnings do you have for the rest of the cohort. Etc.
If you're good, we may applaud. But only if you're good.
