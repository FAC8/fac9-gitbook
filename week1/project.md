# Project 

## Build a blog using GitHub Pages

The first task is to build a group blog. This will be a permanent record of your work over the next several weeks. You will use it to share with each other and to showcase Founders & Coders to the world.

This is an open-ended project on which you will be working for two days. You can make the blog as elaborate as you like and use it as a playground for as many technologies as you are able to research and implement as a team.

As a minimum requirement, your blog should have profiles of each of your group members and each profile should include links to your ```Linkedin```, ```Github``` and ```Codewars``` accounts. Your website should be published on ```gh-pages```. We will also be checking your site for accessibility on Tenon.io

### Managing Your Time

* Use the project introduction hour on Tuesday as a design session, so you can get some experience of creating collaborative designs. 

* Spend Wednesday and Thursday coding; on Friday you'll be responding to issues and debugging.

* You might have already created a web page, but the emphasis here is getting experience designing web pages collaboratively, and coding as a team of four.

* The ultimate aim is to take a very simple design concept from the drawing board to a web page as a team!

###Suggestions for Tuesday's Design Session (45 Minutes)
* Discuss what pages and features you want your website to have
* Think about what you want your web page to look like - feel free to take inspiration from other sites you've seen!
* If you have time, try drawing out wireframes of your page. It's okay to design parts of a page that won't function (e.g. menu buttons) as well as think about elements that might enhance your user's experience.  Try to think about how it might break or annoy a user.

#####We're looking for answers to the following questions:
* What would your overall app do?
* Who is your user?
* How will you enhance the user experience?
* How will you make it pretty?


### Wednesday Morning: Planning and Setup (30 mins)
* Write a README for your app - WHY / WHAT / HOW. Finish with a bullet-point project plan, and mark your more ambitious features as "stretch goals".

* Groups should split into pairs, making sure they are constantly communicating with each other. Divide the tasks between the pairs, and decide how you will work together to avoid conflicts in the code.


### Wednesday & Thursday: Do the Codes 
* The goal isn't to break new ground, it's to get everyone working together (and hopefully enjoying it!).
* Make sure everyone in your team gets to work on every part of the project.
* Keep updating your README as you proceed - it will form the basis for your presentation at the end of the week.

### Friday Morning: Code Review and Responding to Issues

* You shouldn't be adding any new features after Thursday afternoon. On Friday morning, you'll be swapping code with another team and raising issues.

### Friday Afternoon: Presentations (45 minutes)

As a team, present your very first FAC website (of many). Start with your README, then demo your app, then show us your code. Tell us all about the sacrifices you had to make to functionality as the deadline approached. What would you do differently next time? What lessons did you learn about working together as a team? What coding quirks did you encounter? What warnings do you have for the rest of the cohort, etc.

Remember, we're not looking at the quality of what you produce, but the quality of your learning!
