## Build a blog using GitHub Pages

The first task is to build a group blog. This will be a permanent record of your work over the next several weeks. You will use it to share with each other and to showcase Founders & Coders to the world.

This is an open-ended project on which you will be working for two days. You can make the blog as elaborate as you like and use it as a playground for as many technologies as you are able to research and implement.

As a minimum requirement, your blog should have profiles of each of your group members and each profile should include links to your ```Linkedin```, ```Github``` and ```Codewars``` accounts. Your website should be published on ```gh-pages```. We will also be checking your site for accessibility on Tenon.io
