##Github introduction
The aim of the workshop is to give students experience and understanding in using GitHub to build static web pages, as well as using CSS and .js files as separate resources for a static form.

Students will gain some experience using CSS to alter the appearance of elements on the page. In addition, they will replicate jQuery functions with vanilla JavaScript which will help them to understand how both JavaScript and jQuery manipulate DOM elements.


###Today you will...
* Use GitHub as a team
* Go through the basic app design process as a team
* Build a web form using .html, .css and .js files

###Objectives
* Create a team repo on GitHub
* Separate CSS and JavaScript from an HTML file
* Use CSS to alter the appearance of DOM elements
* Use JavaScript to log form data to the console
* Use JavaScript to add form data to the DOM
* Road Map

##Plan
###Introduction (5 minutes) (1200)
Outline for the day, presenting road-map, introducing first task.

###Gitflow workshop (with Heather)

#####GitHub from Day 1
* Introduce groups to good GitHub organisation and team-working practices
* Introduce groups to manipulating the DOM
* Exercise 1 (45 minutes)
Students will separate out hard-coded CSS and JS from a static page. Groups will split into pairs with one pair tackling the HTML and CSS, and the other the JavaScript. Each pair will submit a pull request to the repo and the other pair will approve the merge.You will have merge conflicts as this is all in one file, so we will go through how to correct them.

#####Task list:
* Set up Github for your group (giving everyone the right permissions)
* Split into pairs for HTML/CSS and JS
* Go to [this repo](https://github.com/katbow/FAC8day1)
* Fork the repo and clone onto your local machines
* Separate out CSS and JavaScript from document
* Review (10 minutes)
* Each group will share a challenge they faced and their solution with the group
* Instructor will ask groups for brief examples of good/bad practice, and offer up tips
