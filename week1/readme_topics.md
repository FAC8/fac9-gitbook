# Research Day

We're going to be using our new git skills to work in groups of four to write READMEs. Each group needs to choose a topic, with each member of the group researching one of its four sub-topics. Create a markdown file in the README repo, and `pull` and `push` to keep it updated as you all work. Don't panic if you face a merge conflict - work together as a team to resolve it.

Some of the sub-topics may take longer than others - if you finish earlier than the rest of your team, pair up with someone to help them finish.
