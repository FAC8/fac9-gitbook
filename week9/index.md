# Weeks 9-10
These are your last two weeks of the this part of FAC's journey so 
###WELL DONE!!! 
In the next two weeks you will be introduced to core concepts and ideas of User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) design.

Whether you are interested in design or not, these are really important concepts to know and understand. These concepts are often overlooked by web devs, but we think that knowing about it will make you a much better developer!

The project this week is a long 'sprint' (Friday till thursday) and it will incorporate all the knowledge you have learned in these last 10 weeks. 
enjoy! :)
