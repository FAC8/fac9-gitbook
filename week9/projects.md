##Now make it!

### 8 people, 6 days, 2 groups!

Use the knowledge of the last 10 weeks to build two different projects, all together, in two loving and supporting teams!

What you choose to build and how you choose to display it is up to you.
We suggest you spend any time you have on:

- UX/UI principals learned this week
- TDD it!
- work as a team, dividing roles and doing stand-ups
- use github issues and labels 
- think carefully about your project as an MVP, how and what to prioritize.
- Use any of the programming knowledge you learned, but keep it simple!
- most importantly - have fun!!!!
