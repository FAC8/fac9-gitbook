+ What is authentication and why do we need it when building web applications?
+ What are authentication schemes and strategies?
+ What are some of the different ways Hapi implements authentication?

### Validation

+ What is validation and why is it important (absolutely critical)?
+ What is Joi and how would you use it with Hapi?
+ Find some example situations where you'd use Joi
+ Set up some validation schemas for these examples

### Templating

+ What is a templating engine and why would you use it?
+ What is Handlebars.js?
