#Research day

## Research Topics

Splitting into groups: jigsaw!
Suggested formats: demonstration + small readmes + quiz

### Session management and browser storage
(We will only be using cookies this week but there are many ways that the browser stores data that are worth knowing about)

+ What are Web SQL and Indexed DB?
+ What are local storage and session storage?
+ What is caching and why is it important for your application's performance?
+ What is a cookie?
+ What are some of the different ways Hapi implements session management?

The hapi.js [cookies](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/cookies?lang=en_US) and [caching](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/caching?lang=en_US) tutorials may be of use to you.

### Authentication
(We'll be covering this topic in much more depth later but for now just an introduction to it!)

+ What is authentication and why do we need it when building web applications?
+ What are authentication schemes and strategies?
+ What are some of the different ways Hapi implements authentication? 
+ Build a small project which demonstrates authentication using Hapi.

The hapi.js [authentication](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/auth?lang=en_US) tutorial may be of use to you.

### Validation

+ What is validation and why is it important (absolutely critical)?
+ What is Joi and how would you use it with Hapi?
+ Create a small project demonstrating some example situations where you'd use Joi.
+ Set up some validation schemas for these examples.

The hapi.js [validation](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/validation?lang=en_US) tutorial may be of use to you.

### Templating

+ What is a templating engine and why would you use it?
+ What is Handlebars.js?
+ Write some examples of how you'd use Handlebars
+ What are the advantages of using server side rendering vs rendering dynamic content on the client?
+ How would you use Hapi's `views` interface to serve dynamic content?

The hapi.js [views](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/views?lang=en_US) tutorial may be of use to you.
