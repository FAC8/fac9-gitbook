# Readme Topics (Postgres)

Get into 4 jigsaw groups and research the following main topics. Each team will produce a short readme, as well as a brief presentation and/or a tutorial.
### Why Postgres / SQL databases (or not)?
A **presentation** on the following:
* SQL vs NoSQL databases:
  * differences
  * pros and cons
* When to use which and why? Give example use cases.
* Why do some projects use both?

### Choosing tables structure and joining
* Best practices in table structures (e.g. normalization)
* What is a primary key and why is it useful?
* How do you join separate tables?
* Differences between inner / outer joins
* Give a practical example of a database with at least 2 tables.
Follow some of the best practices you found out (e.g. for people records). The example can even be "on paper".

### PG with Node and Heroku
Give a practical tutorial (for your peers to complete) on the following:
* connect to a local pg database from your node server;
* apply some SQL commands of your choice to retrieve and modify a database;
* create a heroku test app with postgres and access the database with SQL commands:
  * from node;
  * from the command line.

### Importing, exporting and migrating databases
Write a readme including:
* A practical walk-through on how-to:
  * import databases from an existing project
  * export databases
* Migrations in Postgres
