#Pre-Course Materials

FAC is a very intense course, and you should make sure you're well-rested and ready to work when you get here. However, we would highly recommend putting the time in to ensure you have a good understanding of a few basics before we get started:

#### Front End Fundamentals
Codewars is great for learning JavaScript in isolation, but at FAC you'll be spending the majority of your time working on real projects. [Free Camp Code](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) is great for working on your skills in context – we would particularly recommend the **HTML5 and CSS** & **Object Oriented and Functional Programming** courses. 

However, don't forget that **we don't use frameworks at FAC** – ignore Bootstrap and JQuery, and make sure you work in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

From our experience, you'll also find working on a personal project *very* useful; check the **Intermediate Front End Development Projects** section on Free Code Camp for some inspiration, or think of an idea yourself – previous FAC students have built stopwatches, personal websites, and noughts and crosses games.

####Git and GitHub
FAC ❤️s Open Source. You'll be using Git and GitHub in everything you build with us, so it's vital you understand how to work with them. We would recommend going through at least one of these courses and, if possible, get some experience of working on a GitHub repo as part of a group:

* [Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git)
* [Git-It](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron)
* [How to Use Git and GitHub](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

####Using the Command Line
You'll be using the command line a lot during the course, so do take the time to get comfortable using it to move around your computer and install programmes – we can recommend [Getting to Know the Command Line](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/) as a good introduction.

####DOM Manipulation
The #1 thing we wish we'd known more about when we started at FAC is DOM manipulation. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) and [Tuts+](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-and-the-dom-series-lesson-1--net-3134) have good guides to the DOM, and you can take a stab at this [DOM manipulation tutorial](https://dom-tutorials.appspot.com/static/index.html). It would also be worth your time to try working with the DOM in a project.
