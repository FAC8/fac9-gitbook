# Tools to setup for precourse
We will have an **installation party on June 2, 2016**, where you will get plenty of support installing the necessary tools. You will however need a text editor to get through the precourse exercises.

#### Text Editor
We strongly recommend to use **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**. It's open source, has plenty of features and add-on packages.

#### Setup tips (incl. Git, Command Line, Github)
By now you should have already used git, github and your command line. Go through [this readme](https://github.com/dwyl/dev-setup) for a few setup tips on them and on  Atom.
