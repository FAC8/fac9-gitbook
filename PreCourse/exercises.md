# Exercises
We strongly believe in working in groups so, if possible, it would help your learning experience to find a partner to work with (you can do this remotely too!).

At FAC, we also encourage learning through your own research.

## Command Line, Git, Github

#### Topics to research
**You will not get very far without knowing how to...**
* Navigate your file system with the following commands:
  * ```cd``` & ```cd ..```
  * ```mkdir``` & ```touch```
  *  ```ls``` & ```ls -a```
  *  ```rm```
  *  ```mv```
  *  ```cp```

* Starting a git project on git / github. In a project this will typically happen by:
  * Creating a repo on Github, initializing it with a readme, cloning it to a local folder
  * Navigating online to an existing Github repo and clone it to a local folder

You could find it convenient to **learn shortcuts and convenient commands** such as
  * ```&&```
  * aliases on your bash profile

...and know what a **gitignore** is and why it is useful.

## HTML5 / CSS
#### Topics to research
**You will not get very far without knowing about/how to...**
* Create an html document (this is very easy with Atom's autocomplete!)
* Give **classes** and **id**'s to **divs**
* **Input** fields and **forms**
* **Buttons**
* CSS selectors (how to target the correct one)

#### Practice
* Make your own grid system (without bootstrap).
* Look through the animations [here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) and Build something that inspires you with a cool transition!

## JS
#### Topics to research
**You will not get very far without knowing...**
* Array methods such as ```map```, ```reduce```, ```forEach```, ```filter```
* ```document.getElementById```, ```addEventListener```
* How to **change classes dynamically**

#### Practice
* [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com), which allows great practice with functions, arrays, and objects, but little/none on DOM manipulation.
* You should practice DOM manipulation with a..

## Project from home
* Create a simple webpage about you and your experience in learning programming and web development so far. **No frameworks** (e.g. jQuery, Bootstrap, etc.). You could, for example, include:
  * About section
  * Contact section
  * Navbar (e.g. links between About section and Contact section)
