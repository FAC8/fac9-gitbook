# Stop Go Continue

## Stop
- Strong preference to have some kind of forced accountability at the end of the research days. The screencasts in week 2 were good for this reason. Similarly, presentations of research or having to do a quiz at the end could also work.
- Strong preference for taking time to implement something themselves. Walkthroughs and Code-alongs are only helpful to an extent. Again, week 2 example of this.
- Less time on READMEs / reasearch

## Go
- async JavaScript, callback chains
- hiding API keys (this was covered in one of the READMEs)
- community recommendations: 5-10 mins during the week (maybe Mondays) for people to talk about jobs, events etc.


## Continue
- APIs
