# Workshop
In this workshop we will be implementing an OAuth workflow from scratch using the Github API. The full OAuth guide for github can be found [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/).

Pair up and try to complete each step in turn.

#### Step 1 -- Setup a basic Web server
We need a server running before we can do anything.
* Create a new npm project
* Install `hapi` and `inert`
* Create a simple Hapi server that serves up a 'Hello World' `html` file at `/`
* Create a `config.env` file for your project and store your server address in a variable called `BASE_URL`

#### Step 2 -- Register your app
Github needs to know about your app before it will let you authenticate users with it.
* Go to Github profile settings > OAuth applications > Developer applications > Register new application
* Register your app. Call it what you like
* In the `homepage url` field type your `BASE_URL` (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`)
* In the `authorization callback url` field, type your `BASE_URL` + `/welcome` (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/welcome`)
* Add two new variables to your `config.env`: `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`, taken from your app page.

#### Step 3 -- Create your login route
This is the url on our server which will begin the OAuth workflow.
* In your Hapi server, create a route `GET /login` which redirects the user to `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize` along with two query parameters:
  * `client_id`
  * `redirect_uri`
* Hint: use the `querystring` native module to generate your query string. What is `reply.redirect`?

#### Step 4 -- Create your redirect route
We provided a redirect URI to Github to which it will send the user after they have logged in and granted our app permission. Now we should create that route on our server to retrieve the access token that we need to access the Github API on behalf of the user.
* In your Hapi server, create a route `GET /welcome` which sends a request to 
```
POST https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
```
* The body of the request needs the following fields:
  * `client_id`
  * `client_secret`
  * `code`
* For now, simply reply with the body of the response.
* Hint: the `code` will be sent to you at the redirect URI as a query parameter (e.g. `/welcome?code=foo`. How do you access query parameters using the `request` object?

#### Step 5 -- Store your access token
We can now use our access token to make requests to the Github API on behalf of the authenticated user. But before we can do that we need a way to store the token so we can access it in other routes.

Typically, this is done either in a database, a cookie or JSON web token (jwt). As we used hapi-auth-cookie last week, we'll use it again to store our github access token.

#### Step 6 -- Use your access token
Now create another route, with any name, that uses your access token to send a request to the Github API. Explore the Github API. If you're stuck for ideas, try to follow a user using an API request. You may need to re-authenticate the using the `user:follow` scope.
