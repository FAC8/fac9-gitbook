### Create an autocomplete website
A great (search) word finder (user experience) always starts with autocomplete

Your task is to build a site which will update as you type similar to [this](https://github.com/dwyl/autocomplete)

You will need a large```.txt``` file to search through for your auto-completing, there's loads on google if you look hard enough.

#### Don't forget
*  We expect to see testing on both the front-end and back-end (using tape)
*  Aim to have as much code coverage as possible (i.e. as much of your code tested as possible.)

#### Stretch goals

Not mandatory: if you find the time 

* module.exports -- on Monday afternoon we discussed how to take a single large server file and break it down into smaller modules. Consider what would be a good folder structure for your app.
* host the project on heroku -- when you do this make sure
