### Create an autocomplete website
A great (search) word finder (user experience) always starts with autocomplete

Your task is to build a site which will update as you type similar to [this](https://github.com/dwyl/autocomplete)

You will need a ```.txt``` file to search through for your auto-completing, there's loads on google if you look hard enough

#### Don't forget
*  We expect to see testing on both the front-end and back-end
*  >80% coverage
* A full suite of repo badges in your Readme
