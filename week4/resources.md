### Getting started

Before we get started on week 4 we expect you to have downloaded node onto your machine.
If you have problems installing it please get in touch over the weekend or arrive early on
Monday so there is time to sort it before we start.

You can download node here: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).
