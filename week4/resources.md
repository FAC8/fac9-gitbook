# Resources

### Getting started

Before we get started on week 4 we expect you to have downloaded node onto your machine.
If you have problems installing please get in touch over the weekend or arrive early on
Monday so there is time to finish installing before we start.

We would recommend installing node using homebrew. You can find a tutorial on doing this [here](https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x).

Node can also be downloaded from here: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).


### "Homework"

Optional. If you have time over the weekend:

* Read [The Art of Node](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node), a beginners guide to node.
* Have a go at the interactive tutorial [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) created by [nodeschool](https://nodeschool.io/).
