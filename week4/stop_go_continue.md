# Stop Go Continue

### STOP
- Readme presentations being so long + in depth (TeachME day!)
- Stop testing core functionality (don't test the obvious like HTTP module)
- Having no microwave
- lollipopping individuals (puts people on the spot)
- putting knives on drying rack
- carefully targeted speakers (Make sure speaker is aware of the level of knowledge of the group)

###GO

 - Tea + Coffee kitty
 - presentation workshops, feedback of presentations
 - clarify what to test and not to test
 - Paint & Clearout day! Sunday?
 - A more applied test workshop
 - clarify callbacks at the start of week 3
 
 
###CONT
- step by step workshops like Nodegirls
- explaining new things like you've never heard of them before
- well thought of projects
- node shell workshop!
- Adjusting timings based on our needs without sacrificing the content of the week
- resources few enough to feel manageable
- present on Monday
- Make event loop video mandatory
