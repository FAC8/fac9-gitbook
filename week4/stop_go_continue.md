# Stop Go Continue

### STOP
##### Political Discussions
They are distracting and can get heated and personal.

##### Tardiness
Can be disruptive, especially if working in pairs. Maybe start more promptly even if not everyone isn’t there.

Ultimately needs to be agreed within your teams — thats where your primary responsibility is.

###GO
##### Algorithms
Important and interesting part of programming and comp/sci in general and not really covered in the course itself.

Not really priority though, given how much is already on the course. Evenings sessions could be an idea for those who are interested.

We should come back to the conversation if it becomes something that is consistently wanted.

Could cover most basic algorithmic interview style questions if we can be creative with the schedule.

Good to be reminded of gaps in the course.

###CONT
##### Hard Async
Self explanatory

##### More/Better Markers
Will get some next week from FACs Amazon prime acct.
